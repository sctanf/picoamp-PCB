# indexspeakerdacsmol

compact usb-i2s dac using rp2040 and max98360a for powering speakers, like index bmr drivers

* I forgot the silkscreen for usb pins, but they should be clear from below images.
* 0201 components suck to work with.
* intended to use with a usb-c cable, however the CC wire needs 5.1K pull-down to ground which I forgot about

firmware for the device is at https://github.com/sctanf/picoamp
